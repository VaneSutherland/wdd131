            <div class="row">
                <img src="images/vane.webp" alt="Vanessa Sutherland" class="img-right">
                <p> Hello! My name is Vanessa Sutherland, and I was born and raised in Santiago, Chile. I pursued a
                    degree in Geology and have since worked as a geotechnical engineer,
                    using my expertise to understand and work with the natural landscapes that have always inspired me.
                    Beyond my professional life, I'm a enthusiast photographer, capturing the colors and unique
                    landscapes of the world around me.
                    My weekends often find me trekking or spending time with my family.
                    Recently, I've taken up programming to integrate technology into my work, aiming to combine my
                    scientific knowledge with innovative digital tools.
                    I look forward to what the future holds, eager to continue learning, growing, and making a positive
                    impact.</p>

                <h3>Santiago, Chile</h3>
                <img src="images/chile.webp" alt="Chilean Flag" class="img-left">
                <p>Chile is a long, narrow country stretching along the western edge of South America, bordered by the
                    Pacific Ocean to the west and the Andes Mountains to the east.
                    It is known for its diverse landscapes, ranging from the arid Atacama Desert in the north, the lush
                    forests and lakes of the south,
                    and the towering peaks of Patagonia. Chile also has a rich cultural heritage, with big cities like
                    Santiago, the capital, offering a mix of modernity and tradition.
                    The country's unique geography and varied climates make it a popular destination for outdoor
                    enthusiasts, offering activities such as hiking, skiing, and surfing.</p>
